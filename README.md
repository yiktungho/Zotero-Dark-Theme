[Do this to force OS dark mode to get dark titlebar and white text color](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/forcing-third-party-applications-to-use-dark-mode.2134382/)

Some extra known issues:
* Tooltip color not ideal
* Import window color not ideal
* A lot of other stuff in preferences/style editor etc.

To use it follow the following steps:

1 - Go to your user Profile folder - C:\Users\User_name\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\user_profile.default\
                                   mac: /Users/username/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/letters.default

2 - Create a chrome folder,

3 - Place the userChrome.css file in there,

4 - Start Zotero and enjoy


I  encourage everyone to play around with this and try to improve on it and theme things that I didn't manage to. These include the following elements:

1 -  couldn't theme the scrollbars (even tried creating a userContent.css  like in Firefox but it didn't work), 

2 - the tag box and tag text color,

3 - the  menus colors,

4 - the New Item sub-menu in the File drop down menu (it assumes the white color of the menu categories),

5 - the sub-categories in the Preferences dialog. I am not satisfied with the preferences dialog but it's the best I could make it.
